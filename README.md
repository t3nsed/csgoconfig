# csgo config
because some have been asking for it

## features

* scroll to change the scaling of the minimap
* `q` is quickswitch
* `n` toggles a larger crosshair for smoke lineups. This is hardcoded for my crosshair, just google how to do it for your own crosshair.
* `alt` toggles the jumpthrow. Line up a nade and left-click, then press `alt`.
* damage done to enemies in the last round is portrayed in the top-left corner at the start of the next round
* developer mode is enabled, showing you some otherwise hidden info such as server location, teammate geoip and ~~map of the server~~ (depreciated since this is always shown in panorama)
